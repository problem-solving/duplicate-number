# duplicate-number

We have a list of integers, where:

1. The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
2. The list has a length of n+1n+1

Our list has at least one integer which appears at least twice. 
It may have several duplicates and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

Write a function which finds any integer that appears more than once in our list.

The solution must be optimized for space
